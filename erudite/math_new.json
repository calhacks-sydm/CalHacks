However, there is a small mistake in your approach.

Let's break it down step by step.\\n\\nThe area of one side of the roof can be calculated by multiplying the length and width of the rectangular side. In this case, the length is 20 feet and the width is 40 feet. So, the area of one side of the roof is 20 feet * 40 feet = 800 square feet.\\n\\nSince each roof has two sides, we need to multiply the area of one side by 2.

To do this, we add up all her scores and divide by the number of exams she has taken. In this case, Kim has taken 4 exams, so her current average score is:\\n\\n(87 + 83 + 88 + 90) / 4 = 348 / 4 = 87\\n\\nNow, let's calculate what her average score would be if she received a score of 90 on the fourth exam. We add up all her scores, including the new score, and divide by the total number of exams:\\n\\n(87 + 83 + 88 + 90) / 4 = 348 / 4 = 87\\n\\nAs you can see, her average score remains the same at 87. Therefore, the increase in her average score is 0, not 4 as you calculated.\\n\\nRemember, when calculating the increase in average, we need to consider all the previous scores and their impact on the average.\"}", "{\"problem\": \"About 450 000 people lived in Maryville in 2000.
